In the previous experiments, we kept the value of $k$ that minimized the square error on the training set.

Ideally, we would like that the designed regression model works as well as possible on future unlabeled patterns that are not available during the training phase. This property is known as <i>generalization</i>. Fitting the training data is only pursued in the hope that we are also indirectly obtaining a model that generalizes well.

Cross-validation allows us to do so by following the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Split the training data into several (generally non-overlapping) subsets. If we use M subsets, the method is referred to as M-fold cross-validation. If we consider each pattern a different subset, the method is usually referred to as leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation.\n",
    "   - Carry out the training of the system $M$ times. For each run, use a different partition as a <i>validation</i> set, and use the restating partitions as the training set. Evaluate the performance for different choices of the hyperparameter (i.e., for different values of $k$ for the k-NN method).\n",
    "   - Average the validation error over all partitions, and pick the hyperparameter that provided the minimum validation error.\n",
    "   - Rerun the algorithm using all the training data, keeping the value of the parameter that came out of the cross-validation process."
