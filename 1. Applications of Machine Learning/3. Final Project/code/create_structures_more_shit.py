# # We want to create a numpy structure where:
# 	Â· [1] Crear estructura por objetos.
# 		Por cada objeto:
# 			- Identificador del objeto
# 			- Tipo 
# 			- Pujas. (Array) 
# 				Por cada puja (ordenadas temporalmente) poner:
# 					- Quien pujo (identificador, IP, localizacion...)
# 					- Tiempo en el que se pujo
# 					- Cantidad pujada
#==============================================================================


#==============================================================================
# # For that, we serach through the "bids" Dataframe, obtaining all the bids with 
# # the same "auction" value (also eliminate them from the whole structe when readint them)
# # Search process is as follows: 
#     - Search the bids, position by position. For every row of the table
#     - Get the "auction" and compare it with the ones already obtained.
#     - Add it to the corresponding auction list. if it disnt exists create list.
#     - Every bid of this structure will have the proerties: 
#         - Who made the bid
#         - Time of the bid
