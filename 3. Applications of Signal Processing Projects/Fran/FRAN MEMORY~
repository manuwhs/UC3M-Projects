Abstract
Introduction
Image Preprocessing

The dataset is composed of XXX images of different size, ilumination... 
The first step is to preprocess them in order to make them of same size...
Ideally, subjects detection should be independent to rotation, scaling and luminosity.
In this paper, the algorithm proposed first detects de eyes in order make it rotation and
scale invariant. All faces are looking straigh so there is no need for multimodal detection.

Feature Extraction

PCA
LDA
ICA

Classification

LR, LDA, KNN, SVM...

Results

Colclusion final results.



PCA .

Obtain projection into hyperplanes that maximize the variance of the projected data. 
Every vector obtained is a hyperplane of the input space. 
If you multiply an image by this hyperplane you obtain the feature (projection)
The hyperplanes are the eigenfaces and they tell you the contribution of every pixel for that feature.
